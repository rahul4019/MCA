# Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine
# (JVM). It allows you to write Python code that can seamlessly interact with Java classes and libraries.

# Key Features of Jython:
# Python on the JVM: Jython is a Python interpreter written in Java that compiles Python code into Java bytecode,
# allowing Python to run on the JVM.
#
# Interoperability: Jython enables Python code to easily interact with Java libraries, classes, and frameworks.
# You can import Java packages and use them just like Python modules.
#
# No Need for a Separate Interpreter: Unlike standard Python (CPython), which requires its own interpreter,
# Jython uses the JVM to run Python code, making it easier to integrate Python into Java-based applications.
#
# How Jython Works:
# Compilation to Bytecode: When you run a Python script using Jython, the script is first compiled into Java bytecode,
# not native Python bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the JVM.
#
# Integration with Java: Jython allows direct interaction with Java code. For example, you can instantiate Java objects,
# call Java methods, and inherit from Java classes using Python syntax.
